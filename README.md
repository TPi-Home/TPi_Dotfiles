# TPi_linux_configs
A work in progress gruvbox theme for i3-wm and polybar.


I am sick of redoing my config files when I migrate systems, so I will put them here. Leaving public in case anybody else wants to use them. i3 uses VIM keybindings. I do use a small amount of gaps and polybar. i3Status config code with the same color scheme is commented out.
